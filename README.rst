Description and installation
=============================

CosmoMC-relike uses the generic sampler of CosmoMC to sample the fortran implementation of the `relike` likelihood. 

For more information on CosmoMC and getdist (the plotting package), see `here <https://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/readme.html>`_. 

- Install/Load MPI (optional)

  It is recommended to load/install MPI for running chains. To do so
  
  - On a cluster: Find and load the MPI module (e.g. `openmpi`, `mpich` or `pmi`) on the cluster using `module avail` and `module load XX`; consult the cluster’s user guidelines).
  - On a laptop: Install `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ using your system’s package manager (`sudo apt install libopenmpi` in Debian-based systems)

- Make sure all submodules are updated during cloning::

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/chenheinrich/CosmoMC-relike.git 
      cd CosmoMC-relike
      
- If you already cloned without using the --recurse-submodules flag, you can still update the submodules::

      cd CosmoMC-relike
      git submodule update --init --recursive https://github.com/chenheinrich/CosmoMC-relike.git 
  
- Compile the code with MPI. 

  - This is the default option, which is recommended for running chains (so you can calculate convergence statistics during the run):: 

      make
  
  - To compile without MPI::

      export BUILD=NOMPI
      make
  
- Untar the chain files used for KDE::

     tar -zxvf relike_data/pl18_zmax30/chains.tar.gz -C relike_data/pl18_zmax30/

- Run an example for a single tanh model in KDE mode:: 

    ./cosmomc relike_example_tanh_kde_single_point.ini

- Run an example chain for the tanh model in Gaussian mode without MPI (or with MPI):: 

    ./cosmomc relike_example_tanh_gauss_chains.ini (mpirun -np 4 ./cosmomc relike_example_tanh_gauss_chains.ini)

Related code
==================

The Python package `relike <https://github.com/chenheinrich/RELIKE>`_ is a python 
version of the reionization effective likelihood code used in CosmoMC-relike. 
- It includes only the Gaussian approximation mode for now (it does not have the KDE mode).
- You can easily incorporate the python likelihood with other samplers such as `Cobaya <https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya>`_
or `CosmoSIS <https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis/wiki/Home>`_
